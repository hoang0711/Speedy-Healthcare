Netlify: https://speedymd-healthcare.netlify.app/

## Database Project Overview
The SpeedyMD Healthcare System is designed to streamline the process of managing patient data, physician information, tests, and diagnoses in small clinics or
healthcare facilities that experience an average of 250-500 patient visits annually. The system supports multi-location organizations, ensuring that facilities 
spread across different areas can seamlessly manage and share data. This database-driven application allows the end user to share patient information, log test results, 
manage physician assignments, and update diagnoses seamlessly in one place. Itâ€™s designed to give users full control over managing patient care from admission to discharge, 
ensuring that data is easily accessible for tracking and updates. The system can manage hundreds of patients and thousands of medical interactions, ultimately allowing 
professionals to make informed decisions in patient care while improving the organization and efficiency of healthcare operations.
